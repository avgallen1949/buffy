        <p>Considering what it means,<br>
            To call myself a socialist, a feminist.<br>
            A collection of ideas, tiny steel shavings that stream<br>
            Toward one pole or another. The dream of my grandmother<br>
            Speaking, her words coming up clearer and stronger<br>
            Until the walls ripple into flames<br>
            And we rush her along on the shoulders of images.<br>
            Images that thud against my forehead at work, on the bus.<br>
            When I look at identical rows of flimsy houses, <br>
            At headlines slimed over men asleep on market st.<br>
            Being a marxist means you have to believe<br>
            Things won’t always be the same.<br>
            That streets flow into rivers.<br>
            That the Bank of America is turning into sand.<br>
            That women walk out of the shadows<br>

        <p>Last night I dreamt that every open space was owned, built up.<br>
            You put your foot in that soft stretch of grass, and when <br>
            You turn around, the ground’s shaped bare, ready<br>
            For concrete to stop it breathing. They keep side-swiping<br>
            My car from an angle, as the want to re-shape it, shave it.<br>
            Hit and run spectators nail my cat in under the porch.<br>
            Her face collects itself in the darkness and at a certain instant, <br>
            Appears, particles of light glancing back from round green eyes.<br>
            I take a step back and my elbow hits a wall, I shift my weight<br>
            And my knees bang into a table, they are cutting the fat<br>
            From hospitals and schools, they say I cannot teach<br>
            If I touch a woman with love.<br></p>

        <p>It’s like being sick all the time, I think, coming home from work,<br>
            Sick in that low-grade continuous way that makes you forget <br>
            What it’s like to feel well. We have never in our lives known<br>
            What it is to be well. What if I were coming home, I think,<br>
            From doing work that I loved and that was for us all, what <br>
            if I looked at the houses and the air and the streets, knowing<br>
            They were in accord, not set against us, what if we knew the powers<br>
            Of this country moved to provide for us and for all people -<br>
            How would that be - how would we feel and think<br>
            And what would we create?

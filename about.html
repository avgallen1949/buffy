    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Gallimaufry is an experimental site I created to ~have fun~ and reconnect with the awe of the internet I had when I was younger. 
    <br><br>
    As I’ve been learning web coding, I’ve been considering my earlier experiences with it through Tumblr and Myspace in the late 2000s. I would find premade HTML and CSS code to copy and past onto my pages and edit with my own content. For a lot of people, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/tumblr-girl-learn-code" target="_blank">particularly girls,</a> this was their introduction to coding. 
    <br><br>
    The ability to create and customize entire sites dedicated to content that didn’t really have a “purpose” other than expressing my own interests feels untenable today in a landscape of social media monopolies. I still use them, but I think this is much more fun. 
    <br><br>
    This site is an homage to the earlier way I and other girls engaged with the internet: creating fan pages, posting streams of consciousness, and messing around.

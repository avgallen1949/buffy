    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        My introduction to coding was through using Tumblr and Myspace in the late oughts. I would find premade HTML and CSS code to copy and paste and edit with my own content, customizing my web pages dedicated to exploration of style, books, and obsessions like One Direction. The ability to create and customize entire sites dedicated to content that didn’t really have a “purpose” other than expressing my own interests feels untenable today in a landscape of corporate social media sites. 

Gallimaufry is a site I created to have fun, reconnect with the awe of the internet I had when I was a child, and to make a space for myself to explore my interests. The site is an ongoing space for me to develop my coding skills and create pages for things I love. Come back soon!
